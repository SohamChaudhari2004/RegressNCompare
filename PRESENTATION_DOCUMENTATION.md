# PRESENTATION DOCUMENTATION

## Project Overview
This project, **RegressNCompare**, aims to provide a comparative analysis of regression models applied to various datasets. It facilitates the understanding of model performance in real-world scenarios, particularly in the context of machine learning applications.

## Architecture
The architecture of the project consists of several components:
- **Data Ingestion**: Module for loading and preprocessing data.
- **Model Training**: Different regression models are implemented and trained on the dataset.
- **Evaluation Module**: Evaluates models based on chosen metrics and visualizes the results.

## Machine Learning Models Details
The project utilizes various machine learning models:
- **Linear Regression**: A simple model for understanding linear relationships.
- **Decision Trees**: For capturing non-linear relationships.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble method to improve accuracy.
- **Gradient Boosting**: For enhanced performance on complex datasets.

## Preprocessing Pipeline
The preprocessing steps include:
1. Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and outliers.
2. Feature Engineering: Creating new features based on existing data.
3. Data Normalization: Scaling features to ensure uniformity.

## Evaluation Metrics
The following metrics are used to evaluate model performance:
- **Root Mean Square Error (RMSE)**: To assess prediction accuracy.
- **R² Score**: To measure the proportion of variance explained by the model.
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: For understanding the average error.

## Visualizations
Key visualizations in the project include:
- **Feature Importance Graphs**: To identify significant features.
- **Model Comparison Charts**: To visualize performance across different models.
- **Residual Plots**: To analyze prediction errors.

## Features
The features utilized in the models include:
- **Numerical Features**: Continuous variables from the dataset.
- **Categorical Features**: Encoded appropriately for model training.

## Performance Benchmarks
The following performance benchmarks were achieved:
- **Linear Regression**: RMSE = X, R² = Y
- **Random Forest**: RMSE = X, R² = Y
- **Gradient Boosting**: RMSE = X, R² = Y

## Technical Highlights
- Implemented cross-validation techniques for robust evaluation.
- Developed a user-friendly interface for model selection and evaluation.
- Optimized hyperparameters for improved model performance.
